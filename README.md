# My Personal Website

Hi! My name is Yi Chen, and I'm a Joint Mathematics and Computing student at Imperial College London.

This is a simple flask website that consists of my portfolio and resume, to serve as a hub to document my achievements, especially as I look into applying for careers.

Although at this point the website mainly consists of front-end webpages and could theoretically be hosted on Github Pages without much work, I am planning to eventually host some of my projects on this page, which may eventually require back-end support.
