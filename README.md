# My Personal Website

Hi! My name is Yi Chen, and I'm a Joint Mathematics and Computing student at Imperial College London.

This is a simple flask website that consists of my portfolio and resume, to serve as a hub to document my achievements, especially as I look into applying for careers.

Although at this point the website mainly consists of front-end webpages and could theoretically be hosted on Github Pages without much work, I am planning to eventually host some of my projects on this page, which may eventually require back-end support. Furthermore, using SQL databases and backend code will increase the portability of my data, as I should be able to transfer the data to a new version of my website without having to copy and paste each item of my resume separately and reformatting it manually.
