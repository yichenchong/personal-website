                I grew up in a diverse international background, and consequently,
                developed a <span class="highlight">wide variety of interests</span>. I'm a huge
                <span class="highlight">tech enthusiast</span>, and I love to
                <span class="highlight">solve problems</span> and <span class="highlight">code</span> (and especially both at once).
                My tech interests range from <span class="highlight">data science</span> to
                <span class="highlight">full-stack development</span>,
                and I also engage in <span class="highlight">engineering, design, and&nbsp;business.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                I'm an <span class="highlight">incredibly fast hands-on learner</span>, with a 
                <span class="highlight">penchant for picking up new skills</span>.
                If you want someone who has great test-taking and right-answer-regurgitation abilities, that's not me.
                However, if you want <span class="highlight">someone who can take projects and execute on them</span> or who can
                <span class="highlight">generate creative solutions to issues</span>,
                I'm&nbsp;your&nbsp;man.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm always <span class="highlight">looking for new opportunities</span>
                to extend and use my skills, so if my background sounds
                like a good fit for you, contact me and let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know!
