    I studied in Shanghai American School, Puxi Campus, under the US Advanced Placement (AP) program.
    Over the course of my 4 years, I achieved a GPA of 
    <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Transcript available upon request.">3.70/4.00</span>, and completed 10 Advanced Placement
    exams. In my first two years of high school, I also completed 
    <a href="https://www.saschina.org/academics/signature-programs/innovation-institute">Innovation Institute</a>,
    an interdisciplinary project-based learning program, which
    was named by <a href="https://hundred.org/en/innovations/innovation-institute">HundrED.org</a> as one of the
    top 100 global education innovations in 2019.

                An interdisciplinary project-based learning program consisting of interdisciplinary
                tasks and projects where students learn critical thinking, collaboration, creativity,
                and the design thinking process. Some example projects include redesigning the Nanjing Massacre
                Memorial for sustainability while constructing a more meaningful narrative about
                the human capacity for good and evil, and creating a short film to depict a dystopia
                that reflects recent scientific developments.
