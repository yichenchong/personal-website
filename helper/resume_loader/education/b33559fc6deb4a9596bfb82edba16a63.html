<!-- Imperial BEng -->
<span>
This duodisciplinary degree, hosted under the Department of Computing, but taught jointly
with the Department of Mathematics is accredited by the British Computing Society. In my studies,
I attend modules under both the pure computing and pure mathematics syllabus. The degree is 3 years,
culminating in a BEng degree, but may be extended to 4 years for an MEng degree. For more information,
