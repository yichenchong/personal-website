                    The story
                </div>
                <p>
                    The organisation FIRST (which stands for “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology”) runs three robotics competitions for different ages: the FIRST Lego League (grades 1-8), the FIRST Tech Challenge (grades 7-12), and the FIRST Robotics Competition (grades 9-12). Our high school only had FIRST Tech Challenge to offer, but when I saw the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), I was determined to bring it to our school. Emboldened by the creation of a Makerspace at our school, I tried to lobby the school to recognise that we had the skill to complete the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got a group of fellow robotics enthusiasts who also wanted to turn this dream into a reality together, and we started an initiative to run a FIRST Robotics Competition team at our school. However, we faced many major challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first challenge came from the Makerspace supervisor, who had run an FRC team before and was unhappy with the amount of time commitment it usually entailed, which prevented us from gaining a foothold on our lobbying with the administration for the first two years. He moved swiftly to block the initiative from taking off, by barring us from Makerspace resources, threatening the school with recognition were the initiative to take off, influencing the robotics leadership to change the current club rules to disallow FRC initiative members from holding key leadership positions within the Robotics Club (which meant I lost my chance to run for Robotics Club leadership), and asking the school to make sure FRC initiative members could not participate in several other activities (I lost my place in Junior Varsity Track and Field and Varsity Model United Nations in the struggle). As the critical lynchpin for our newly created Makerspace, the supervisor could not easily be replaced, especially within the first year, and barred us from success in any form of lobbying.

                <p>
                    Throughout my three years at the helm of the initiative, I spent 10-20 hours every week constructing projections, plans, and proposals, as well as lobbying and negotiating with school administration and staff. I created business plans, fundraising proposals, and project campaigns. While the initiative was ultimately unsuccessful, the educational and fundraising campaigns we started were huge
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second year, after further intensive lobbying, we reached an agreement with the school administration to gain more robotics experience for a year, before we would try to set it up again the following year. We helped with the FIRST Robotics Competition team at our sister campus (Shanghai American School, Puxi Campus) across the city, attending key events, and liaising with their leadership in allowing us to help with their build process, to learn skills that we could bring back with us to our own initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also began thinking of fundraising methods, one of which ended up as the Vending Machine Committee project. The original idea was that while the student union would provide the funds for building this new vending machine, the FRC initiative would provide the manpower and talent, and so FRC and the student union would split the proceeds of the vending machine. It would also serve as a publicity stunt to showcase student talent. Later, when the FRC initiative ultimately failed, the committee members continued the vending machine project, leaving that as our legacy in the school instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third year, which was also my last year of high school, the school finally gave us a go-ahead to run a first season of FRC, after negotiating significant compromise with the administration. We were set to have a similar structure to the sport teams at our school, and to go to the local FRC competition as a sporting event. Alas - it was not to be. A week after we reached the agreement, the Chinese government announced a crackdown on international student competitions in the country; FIRST could not react in time and had to pull its regional competitions out of China for the year. We went back to the school to negotiate alternatives: when they seemed bent on not allowing us to compete overseas, we also proposed a pilot program in which we followed the build season without competing, but this was seen as a waste of resources. We were out of options and had to settle for the school’s assurance that our juniors would have the school’s support the following year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a humorous side note: the following year, COVID struck in the middle of build season, dashing our school’s FRC competition hopes once again. It seems the stars simply did not align, and our initiative seemed like it was fated to fail from the beginning. The Makerspace supervisor has also since lost his job at the school (in part, I personally believe, due to the stubbornness exhibited during our interactions with the administration).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of time and resources I spent on the initiative was enormous. Throughout my three years at the helm of the initiative, I spent 10-20 hours every week constructing projections, plans, and proposals, as well as lobbying and negotiating with school administration and staff. I created business plans, fundraising proposals, and project campaigns. I had to quit the track team, lost my coveted place at Varsity MUN, and lost the opportunity to run for robotics club positions (which I had a reasonably high chance of attaining).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, while the initiative was ultimately unsuccessful, I do not regret the attempt in the slightest. The educational and fundraising campaigns we started were a huge driver in innovation at our school. Apart from the vending machine, the technical arms race between the FRC and FTC factions led to STEM booms across the school and created support for all sorts of other engineering clubs within the school network. It also enabled massive personal growth. My own technical skillset grew, as I led efforts building technical demonstrations meant to rebuff administration opinions that our students did not have the technical capacity. My leadership and communication skills flourished as I was forced into negotiations and lobbying. The initiative enhanced my business abilities, to make plans, proposals, and projections. Perhaps most importantly, the determination forged my perseverance and resilience, that I use in all of my projects to this day.
