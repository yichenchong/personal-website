                    Introduction
                </div>
                <p> 
                    In 2014, the year before I entered high school, my school introduced the Innovation Institute program. This multidisciplinary, project-based learning program combined the science, English, social science, and art/design modules from the 9th and 10th grades. Instead of units or chapters, the program was organised into several multidisciplinary projects in groups of three or four, where we would learn different facets of the project’s material in different classes, to be combined later. Here were some of my favourite projects:

                    Memorial Design
                </div>
                <p>
                    This project, centred around the Second World War in China and around architecture and construction, had us redesigning a museum to commemorate the Nanjing Massacre Memorial. We visited the current Nanjing Massacre Memorial site and were tasked with analysing it and the message it portrayed. Then, we set to work learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Asian History, our social science class for the year, we studied the Second World War, the Nanjing Massacre in particular, and its effects on the Chinese psyche. In English, we studied a class of “grief literature”, and analysed recurring themes. We read Holocaust literature, including Victor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning, poetry describing grief, and analyses about the psychology of grief and how it affects literature and portrayal. In Creativity and Design, our art class for the year, we investigated architecture. We studied the technical aspects of perspective drawing and CAD modelling, as well as the artistic themes that architects use. In physics, we studied sustainability and thermodynamics, and learnt how structures can passively regulate temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we were given the problem of redesigning the Nanjing Massacre Memorial, for sustainability and architecture, and to present a more constructive message regarding the atrocities. We were to create concept art and CAD models of both the interior and exterior, and present the design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our exterior design was inspired by the Buddhist endless knot, as a symbol of Samsara and the endless cycle of suffering. It would be mostly buried underground (the hallways would gently slope to cross over each other, so that some parts of the structure would be aboveground) to symbolize death and burial traditions, but with glass roofing to provide natural lighting. The large surface-area-to-volume ratio could also be used, with adequate ventilation, to passively dissipate large amounts of heat during the summer months, while the half-underground nature of the structure and the glass roofing means that by changing ventilation patterns, it could effectively turn into a greenhouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internally, we built a narrative attempting to give closure to the Chinese. We structured the museum’s interior around the five stages of grief: the narrow hallways of the museum force visitors to progress in a linear fashion through the museum, which lent itself perfectly to forcing the museums through sections of the museum in a certain order. The museum was therefore sectioned off, with each section, and the artifacts presented within, dedicated to a consecutive stage of grief, ending with an acceptance of the past.

                    Brave New World
                </div>
                <p>
                    This project, centred around dystopia, film, and storytelling, got us to construct a dystopian short film for the Shanghai Student Film Festival. My group had never engaged in filmmaking before, but still, with a lot of hard work, we managed to take the top place in the Science Fiction category at the Film Festival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We studied a wide variety of subjects for the project. For English, we studied the titular book, “Brave New World”, with a host of other dystopian literature. For AP Seminar, a philosophical class, we studied art and beauty – with a particular focus on the concept of the sublime. We looked at how Stanley Kubrick’s filmmaking employs the sublime to create beauty while invoking unease in his viewers in both Seminar and Innovation and Design, the second-year art course, where we studied all the various aspects of filmmaking (under the IB film instructor). We investigated genetic and other controversial technologies in biology, exploring their current state, potential future, and their ethical ramifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem we were given was to create a narrative short film centred around the question, “To what extent do we live in a Brave New World?” Our group decided to take a jab at the pleasure-driven economy of mind-altering substances and the global focus on entertainment by imagining where this economy may lead us: a dystopian world where people engage in a cycle of sleeping, consuming nutrition (through a series of injections), and spending the rest of the day in a drug-induced state watching movies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We drew from Robert Nozick’s Experience Machine in portraying that such a pleasurable state, would ironically not, in fact, be satisfying. We also drew inspiration from the Giver, portraying the world in grayscale to enhance the idea of uniformity, while giving the protagonist the ability to see some colour, allowing him to be drawn out of his cycle by a rose, which he sees and perceives as red. He is troubled by it, and the actual non-drug-induced feelings that he experiences, attempting to understand it, experience it, and share it, but is ultimately unsuccessful. He cannot go back to the dystopian cycle but cannot experience life outside it either; Trapped and confused, he takes the rose to the rooftop he found it, before jumping off (off-camera), as the grayscale fades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the film, we all took part in each aspect of the creation: directing, acting, editing, cinematography, and sound design. In particular, the editing was extremely labour-intensive (as we had to key everything but one colour from the screen), and we all came out with a strong Adobe Premiere Pro capability. However, I took a special interest in the sound design. As the film was mostly grayscale, I decided to frame the film around the heavy instrumental use of the noir genre, and disregarded foley almost entirely. However, to portray the dystopian science fiction, I utilized a range of MIDI synths instead of the classic orchestral implementations. I constructed a full 10-minute film score and edited it to fit the music. We submitted our film to the Shanghai Student Film Festival and won first place in the Science Fiction category. Some of the other group members later became prolific filmmakers and hobbyist animators, and we all carry filmmaking as a hobby to this day.

                    Games, War, and Competition
                </div>
                <p>
                    This project was centred around games, war, and competition (<i>go figure</i>). At that point in time, we were studying ecosystems in biology – about scarcity and carrying capacities in nature, and about symbiosis and mutually beneficial relationships. In AP Seminar and English, we studied wars, competition, politics, and cooperation. We explored literature from Hobbes’ Leviathan to Locke and Rousseau’s concepts of social contracts. In Innovation and Design, we explored game design, particularly but not exclusively in the class of board games, and discussed game design considerations (e.g., mechanics and components). We also looked at graphic design and Makerspace construction techniques (3-D printing and laser cutting, for example) that we could use to construct game boards and pieces. In the end, we were asked to create a board game, exploring the extent to which we live in a ‘war universe’ of competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our group decided we would like to create a realistic board game, and through gameplay, figure out the optimal strategies. We were inspired heavily by the Settlers of Catan, but we wished to make improvements in several aspects. First, we felt that the game required more aggressive portrayals of competition, cooperation, and chance, to be more realistic and engaging. We introduced several new game mechanics, including card draws that allow one to cooperate or compete with one another. We added a mechanic to build up armed forces, to encourage players to compete (with the idea that the Prisoner’s Dilemma encourages nations to build their militaries), while also adding natural disaster and chance-based mechanics that may favour competition. Second, we decided to modernize the game. Even with the old mechanics, the game could use a marketing boost from an online companion; with the new and complex mechanics, it was sorely needed to keep track of game progress. We created a score-tracking and random-generation program online to accompany the board game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During gameplay (which we conducted experimentally during the “Game Night”, where friends, family, and staff were invited to come play our games), we found that it was not so much competition or cooperation which determined success, but rather the adaptability of individuals to transition between the two states.

                    Other projects included creating an interactive art exhibition depicting media using electronics and robotics (we built an audio installation that got softer the closer the user was to it), designing a stage for the play "A Raisin in the Sun", and a social campaign, with flyers, posters, brochures, videos, and webpages, championing sustainability.
